1) Docker is a container technology: A tool for creating and maintaining containers.

2) Container is package which contains code and dependencies to run that code. Same container always yields the exact same application and execution behaviour.

3) It creates reliable and reproduciable environments.

4) One container is independent from other containers.

5) Operating System -> Built-in Container support system -> Docker Engine -> (ContainerA, ContainerB ,.....).
    One container for each application.

6) Install Docker Engine, Docker Desktop and Docker CLI. Docker Hub to host the images on cloud. Docker Compose to handle multiple containers for a project.

7) Images and Containers are the two core concepts of Docker.

8) Images are blueprints/templates for Containers. We can create one Image and make multiple containers using that one image.

9) Image contains setup instructions for the code, application code which can be run on any server/machine and Contianers are running instance of the image.
